This is a simple project I built in order to understand better the concept of state in React. Nothing more. Nothing less.

# HOW IT WORKS
1. download this repo
2. run npm i to install all the dependencies
3. run npm start
4. click on the "+" button -> the counter will increase its value by 1
5. click on the "-" button -> the counter will decrease its value by 1
